#1. Create two variables `a` and `b` with numeric values.
a = 5
b = 3

#2. Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of `a` and `b`.
sum = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a
remainder = a % b

#3. Print the results.
print("value of addition - " + str(sum))
print("The difference is - " + str(difference))
print("The product is - " + str(product))
print("The quotient is - " + str(quotient))
print("The remainder is - " + str(remainder))
